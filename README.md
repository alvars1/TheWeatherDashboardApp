# The Weather Dashboard
The reason I'm writing this application is to discover the best practices I could follow in writing a front-end webapp given Vue's centric 'reactive-viewmodel' approach and how does my approach relate to the original GUI-Architecture MVC pattern.

Another reason is that I'd like to formulate the best build setup I'd use given that I'm obliged to use webpack since vue-loader is a webpack plugin.

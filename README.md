# The Weather Dashboard
The reason I'm writing this application is to discover the best practices I could follow in writing a front-end webapp given Vue's centric 'reactive-viewmodel' approach and how does my approach relate to the original GUI-Architecture MVC pattern.

Another reason is that I'd like to formulate the best build setup I'd use given that I'm obliged to use webpack since vue-loader is a webpack plugin.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Pending Features
- Precipitation (shown values are dummies)
- Change settings
- Support multiple screens (This should be a matter of adding a couple of css media queries)
- Set city based on current location
- Connection problems (api retrieval) feedback
